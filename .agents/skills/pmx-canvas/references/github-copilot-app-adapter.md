# GitHub Copilot App Adapter

Use this reference when PMX Canvas is running inside the GitHub Copilot app as a project canvas
extension. The adapter is intentionally thin: PMX Canvas remains the state owner, and the extension
maps Copilot SDK features onto PMX AX primitives.

## Adapter Identity

- Extension path: `.github/extensions/pmx-canvas/extension.mjs`
- Extension ID: `project:pmx-canvas`
- Canvas ID: `pmx-canvas`
- Display name: `PMX Canvas`

## Quick Start

1. Install the project adapter with `pmx-canvas copilot install-extension --yes`, or copy the
   packaged extension directory into the repository:
   `mkdir -p .github/extensions && cp -R node_modules/pmx-canvas/.github/extensions/pmx-canvas .github/extensions/`
2. Reload Copilot app extensions with `extensions_reload` so `project:pmx-canvas` is registered.
3. Start or confirm a PMX Canvas daemon for the workspace: `pmx-canvas serve --daemon`
   and `pmx-canvas serve status`. The adapter can auto-start in many local sessions, but a running
   daemon is the most reliable setup for fresh agents.
4. Open the canvas with `extensionId: "project:pmx-canvas"`, `canvasId: "pmx-canvas"`, and a stable
   `instanceId`.
5. If the first `invoke_canvas_action` immediately after `open_canvas` returns
   `Canvas instance not open`, retry the same action once. This is a known Copilot app timing race
   during panel initialization, not a PMX server failure.

Open it with:

```json
{
  "extensionId": "project:pmx-canvas",
  "canvasId": "pmx-canvas",
  "instanceId": "pmx-canvas"
}
```

Use a different `instanceId` for parallel panels. Reusing an `instanceId` focuses/reloads the same
panel.

## Agent presence (automatic)

The extension also reports Copilot's real context window: the SDK's `session.usage_info`
event (`currentTokens` / `tokenLimit`, root agent only) is posted to the presence as
`contextUsage`, so the board's top-bar meter reads **Context** with the live numbers rather
than the pinned-context estimate (**Pins**).

The extension attaches a Copilot session to the canvas when it joins the host session, flips the
phase to `thinking` on every submitted prompt, and detaches on exit. While attached the workbench
shows the Copilot cursor on the node the agent last touched plus a phase chip, and the agent's
canvas writes — which reach the server as MCP or HTTP tool calls, not as `copilot` — are attributed
to that session by the server. Nothing to configure; `GET /api/canvas/ax/presence` shows the live
state.

## What the Adapter Does

- Opens the live PMX workbench directly in a native Copilot canvas panel.
- Uses PMX-served same-origin frame documents for iframe-backed nodes (`html` and hosted MCP apps).
  The Copilot app webview can leave nested `srcdoc` and `blob:` iframes blank, so PMX should route
  generated frame HTML through `/api/canvas/frame-documents/...` instead.
- Connects to a matching local PMX server for the current workspace, or starts one when needed.
- Reads `/api/canvas/ax/context` and injects pinned/focused context from
  `onUserPromptSubmitted`.
- Exposes adapter actions for status, AX context refresh, AX focus, and explicit session steering.

### Agent behavior — steering push with a gated fallback

The adapter long-polls the consumer-scoped delivery queue, sends each steer through
`copilotSession.send`, and marks it only after the host accepts the prompt. Browser-originated
steering therefore creates a Copilot turn without waiting for another chat message. Addressed
steers follow their target; broadcasts are marked only for the `copilot` consumer; Copilot-origin
messages are excluded by the queue's loop-safety filter.

On adapter startup, existing backlog is marked for the `copilot` consumer without creating turns.
Only steers created after that adapter instance started can wake it, so reopening Copilot cannot
flood the chat with stale instructions from prior sessions.

`onUserPromptSubmitted` remains the fallback. It injects the whole `/api/canvas/ax/context`
(pins, focus, work items, approval gates, and the compact `delivery` lead block) as hidden context,
but only when the **pin/focus gate is open** (`pinned.count > 0 || focus.nodeIds.length > 0`), and
it is clipped to a char budget. Read steering from **`delivery.pendingSteering`** (the compact,
count-bearing block — newest-first, capped at 10), not the full `timeline.pendingSteering`.

If native send fails, the adapter leaves the steer unmarked and retries. If marking fails after a
successful send, the in-process pump retries the mark without sending the prompt twice. A process
restart establishes a new delivery baseline and marks older unacknowledged rows without replaying
them.

To be robust to the char clip, prefer injecting that compact loop-safe lead block from
`GET /api/canvas/ax/context?consumer=copilot` (`delivery.pendingSteering` +
`delivery.totalPending` / `delivery.omittedPending` + `delivery.pendingActivity`)
**above** the full dump. When `omittedPending > 0`, drain the full FIFO backlog from
`canvas_ax_delivery { action: "claim", consumer: "copilot" }` (oldest-first).

#### Waking the agent from a canvas steer (#59) — adapter-owned

Recording a browser-origin `ax.steer` queues it in PMX; the Copilot adapter owns the wake. Its
delivery pump long-polls `…/delivery/pending?consumer=copilot`, calls
`copilotSession.send`, then marks that consumer's delivery. PMX remains host-agnostic and never
imports the Copilot SDK.

### Closing the loop (optional, recommended)

- **Forward tool/session hooks** (`onPreToolUse` / `onPostToolUse` /
  `onPostToolUseFailure` / `onSessionStart` / `onSessionEnd` / `onErrorOccurred`) to
  `POST /api/canvas/ax/activity` (`canvas_ingest_activity`) so the board reflects the
  agent's real work automatically (a failed tool → a blocked work item + review +
  evidence).
- **Await gates** with `canvas_ax_gate { kind, action: "await", id }` (or surface a native modal
  and await the PMX result) so an approval gate actually blocks the agent until the human resolves it.

See [the upstream AX host adapter contract](https://github.com/pskoett/pmx-canvas/blob/1ca1fc7207d85b266e3463c32ae4e7967b523266/docs/ax-host-adapter-contract.md).
- Keeps all persistent PMX state in `.pmx-canvas/canvas.db`; the extension does not own canvas
  state.

## Open Input

All fields are optional:

```json
{
  "serverUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4313",
  "port": 4313,
  "autoStart": true,
  "allowWorkspaceMismatch": false,
  "workspaceRoot": "/path/to/repo"
}
```

Default discovery order:

1. `serverUrl` input.
2. `PMX_CANVAS_URL`.
3. `PMX_CANVAS_PORT` / `PMX_WEB_CANVAS_PORT` / `4313` on loopback.
4. Managed server startup for the current workspace when `autoStart` is not `false`.

The adapter rejects an unrelated running PMX server unless `serverUrl` is explicit or
`allowWorkspaceMismatch` is true.

## Actions

| Action | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `status` | Return PMX server health and persisted AX state. |
| `get_ax_context` | Return current pinned + focused AX context. |
| `focus_nodes` | Set AX focus with `source: "copilot"`. |
| `send_instruction` | Send an explicit prompt into the active Copilot session. |
| `add_work_item` | Create a canvas-bound AX work item. |
| `request_approval` | Open an approval gate (`pending`) before a high-impact action. |
| `resolve_approval` | Resolve an approval gate as approved/rejected. |
| `add_review_annotation` | Record a review comment/finding anchored to a node/file/region. |
| `get_timeline` | Read the bounded AX timeline (events, evidence, steering). |
| `report_capability` | Report host capabilities for diagnostics. |

Example focus action:

```json
{
  "nodeIds": ["node-123"]
}
```

Use `nodeIds: []` to clear adapter-set AX focus after a live test.

## Live-Test Checklist

After changing the adapter:

1. Reload extensions.
2. Inspect `pmx-canvas` and confirm status is `running`.
3. Call `list_canvas_capabilities` for `extensionId: "project:pmx-canvas"` and
   `canvasId: "pmx-canvas"`.
4. Open the canvas with a stable `instanceId`.
5. Invoke `status`.
6. Invoke `get_ax_context`.
7. If at least one node exists, invoke `focus_nodes` for one node ID and confirm
   `get_ax_context.focus.nodeIds` includes it.
8. Clear the focus with `focus_nodes` and `nodeIds: []`.
9. Add or reuse one `html` node and one hosted MCP app node and confirm both render visibly in the
   native PMX panel, not only in an external browser.
10. Inspect the extension log tail and confirm there are no runtime errors.

## Agent Behavior

When this adapter is loaded, the next user prompt may include hidden AX context generated from PMX
pins and focus. Treat pinned nodes and focused nodes as human-selected working context, not as a
global instruction to ignore the rest of the repository.

For non-Copilot agents, use the same core primitives directly:

- HTTP: `/api/canvas/ax`, `/api/canvas/ax/context`, `/api/canvas/ax/focus`
- MCP: `canvas://ax`, `canvas://ax-context`, `canvas_ax_state { action: "get" }`, `canvas_ax_state { action: "set-focus" }`
- CLI: `pmx-canvas ax status|context|focus`
